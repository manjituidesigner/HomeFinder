# Rently

Monorepo-style scaffold with `frontend` (Expo React Native) and `backend` (Node/Express).

Quick start

- Frontend (Expo):

```bash
cd Rently/frontend
npm install
# start with npx (no global expo-cli needed)
npx expo start
```

- Backend (Node):

```bash
cd Rently/backend
npm install
npm start
```

Notes

- The frontend is an Expo app with a modern iOS-like UI starter.
- The backend is a minimal Express API exposing `/api/health` and `/api/properties`.
